# General

The encoder library provides a couple of functions to quickly convert the original BigEarthNet directories to the desired BigEarthNet-Patch-Interface.

The specific functions are:
- {any}`tiff_dir_to_ben_s1_patch`
- {any}`tiff_dir_to_ben_s2_patch`

To read the TIFF files the data has to be read with `rasterio`.
